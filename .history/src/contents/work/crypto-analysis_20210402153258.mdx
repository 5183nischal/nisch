A few days ago, I came across a [blog](https://mikefrost.net/people-somewhere-vs-people-anywhere/)
discussing the concept of Somewhere People vs Anywhere People. These terms were brought up in
_The Road toSomewhere: The populist Revolt and the Future of Politics_ by David Goodhart.

To explain the terms in a simple and concise way, Somewhere people are those who would have a hard time to
survive if they move to somewhere else. They usually have a strong connection to where they are from, not
just emotionally but often financially. Their sense of existence and living a life depends on the sense of
being a "local". Anywhere people are those who identify themselves through their titles and achievements.
Being a "local" or not isn't a big factor in defining who they are. They are more willing to move if they aren't happy
